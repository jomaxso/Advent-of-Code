# Advent of Code Solutions ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„
Welcome to my Advent of Code repository! This repo contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) challenges. Advent of Code is an annual event where each day from December 1st to 25th, a new programming puzzle is released. Itâ€™s a fun way to improve your coding skills and get into the holiday spirit! 

## Structure
- Each dayâ€™s challenge is in its own folder (e.g., Day01, Day02, etc.).
- Each folder contains:
  - input.txt: The puzzle input for that day.
  - solution.cs: My solution in C#.
  - README.md: A brief explanation of the solution and the approach taken.
